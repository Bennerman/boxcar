            Welcome to Boxcar, a streetwear brand based in Madison, Wisconsin. Founded by Benjamin Radosevich, Boxcar draws inspiration from the city's vibrant culture and unique style. The brand was sparked by the art of Benjamin's cousin, Evan Tomczyk, whose work embodies the spirit of the streets.

            At Boxcar, we believe that clothing should be more than just a way to cover up. It should be a statement, a way to express your personality and individuality. That's why we design each piece with care, blending contemporary styles with classic streetwear elements.

            Our pieces are made to be versatile, comfortable, and easy to wear, whether you're hitting the streets or just chilling at home. We focus on quality materials and attention to detail, so you can be sure that each piece will last you for years to come.

            We're passionate about creating a community around our brand and connecting with people who share our love for streetwear and fashion. We hope you'll join us on this journey and discover something new with each piece of Boxcar clothing you wear.
